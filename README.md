    This repository contains the source code for <a href="https://houstonroboticsgroup.com">Houston Robotics Group</a>'s real-time, automatic facial detection + recognition bot named Spud! Also featured in this repo is the accompanying dashboard website for our bot. This is a fusion of web development, AI, and robotics creates an innovative solution for seamless member tracking. As soon as someone walks into the room, our bot will log that into our database, and we're able to see that through a user-friendly interface on our website instantly!

# 🎬 Temporary Demo

This is a quick demo of the UI of the website until we are able to finalize a full demo of the robot, AI face detection, and website working together. Apologies for the GIF quality.

### Who We Are

We are a group of undergraduates studying at University of Houston (Go Coogs!) that want to apply our various skills to create an awesome project! Our goal was to combine web development, embedded systems, robotics, and AI into one large project and expand our working knowledge.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Web**: Node.JS, Express.JS, Socket.io, Google Cloud Platform.
- **Database**: MySQL.
- **AI**: Python, OpenCV.
- **Physical**: Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2.

# 🚏 Frontend Routes

- `/`: Landing page.
- `/register`: Registration page.
- `/logs`: Logs page.
  - Updates in real time using sockets.
  - Responsive.
  - Searchable:
    - `⌘ + F` / `Ctrl + F` shortcut.
    - Includes text highlighting.
  - Sortable.
  - Exportable.
  - Allows for the adjustment of the number of logs displayed.
  - Logs are deleteable (with an animation).
  - Has a skeleton loader when fetching data.
- `/testlogs`: Logs page supplemented with fake data.

> [!CAUTION]
> Every time the real logs are updated through the API, it triggers an update to all connected clients and forces them to re-query the API to to retrieve the newly updated logs. Since fake logs are randomly generated non-deterministically, it causes the unintended side effect of loading in new fake data which can override the previous data in the table for clients that are viewing `/testlogs`.

These plans reflect our ongoing commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and delivering a robust and cutting-edge solution. Stay tuned for exciting updates as we evolve Spud into an even more powerful and feature-rich robot!

# 📋 Todo (Temporary)

- Implement logging.
  - Include IP, requested endpoint, headers, body, params.
- API authentication:
  - Add header token check for sensitive endpoints.
  - Maybe allow all internal requests from server's IP.
    - A better way would be to include an auth token for every internal request.
    - Store tokens in new database table.
  - Update documentation.
  - Add site's IP to GitHub's about section.
- Merging Khanh's branch:
  - Consolidate views/partials:
    - Navbar partial.
    - Favicon partial + theme colors partial.
  - POST `/api/users` for form action.
  - Remove password & PSID fields.
  - Mark inputs as reqiured + make sure input types are correct.
- Finalize repo:
  - Add screenshots.
  - Add a video demo.
  - Compress all images/videos.
  - Delete this todo section once all other todos have been completed.
